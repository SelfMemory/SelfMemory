### Features

**Core SDK:**
- Memory operations: add, search, get_all, delete, delete_all
- Advanced search: temporal_search, search_by_tags, search_by_people
- User management: create_user, generate_api_key, list_api_keys, revoke_api_key
- Configuration: get_config, health_check, context manager support
- Auto-detection of deployment environment (file vs enterprise)

**Storage Backends:**
- **File Storage**: JSON-based storage with atomic writes, perfect for development
- **MongoDB Storage**: Scalable enterprise backend with user collections
- **Storage Abstraction**: Clean interface for additional backends (PostgreSQL coming soon)

**Search Capabilities:**
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search using embeddings
- **Temporal Search**: Date/time-based filtering ("yesterday", "this week", etc.)
- **Tag Search**: Single or multiple tags with AND/OR logic
- **People Search**: Find memories by mentioned people
- **Combined Search**: Mix semantic queries with metadata filters
- **Score Thresholds**: Filter results by similarity scores

**Installation Modes:**
```bash
pip install inmemory                    # Zero dependencies
pip install inmemory[server]            # + FastAPI server
pip install inmemory[enterprise]        # + MongoDB + OAuth
pip install inmemory[full]              # Everything + MCP
```

**API Server:**
- RESTful endpoints for all memory operations
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/docs`
- Health checks and status monitoring
- CORS support for web applications
- User authentication and API key management

**Configuration:**
- Auto-detection based on environment
- YAML configuration files
- Environment variable overrides
- Secure defaults for production use

### Technical Details

**Dependencies:**
- **Core**: qdrant-client, pydantic, python-dotenv, cryptography, httpx
- **Optional**: FastAPI, MongoDB, OAuth providers, MCP, embedding models

## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - "Zero Setup"

This initial release focuses on **ease of use** and **progressive complexity**. You can start using InMemory immediately with zero configuration, then scale up to enterprise features as needed.

**Key Highlights:**
- üöÄ **Zero Setup**: `pip install inmemory` and start using immediately
- üèóÔ∏è **Flexible Architecture**: File ‚Üí API Server ‚Üí Enterprise MongoDB
- üîç **Advanced Search**: Semantic, temporal, and metadata-based search
- üö´ **Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligent memory deduplication
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Multiple Backends**: File storage and MongoDB with more coming
- üåê **API Ready**: Full REST API with OpenAPI documentation

### Breaking Changes
None (initial release).

### Migration Guide
This is the initial release, so no migration is needed.

### Contributors
