# SelfMemory

**Store AI memories for you and your agents**

It is a open-source universal memory engine where users can store and retrieve their AI conversations and context across different models. Users can add memories through MCP, SDK, or a website selfmemory.com Over time, this will evolve into a one-stop memory hub with note-taking and chatbot features. For B2B, it becomes a knowledge backbone, storing project context, organizational knowledge, documents, and data sources to power company-wide AI systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install selfmemory
```

```python
from selfmemory import SelfMemory

memory = SelfMemory()

# Add memories
memory.add("Can you find the nearest BMW car showroom for me.", user_id="user")

# Search memories
results = memory.search("Can you find a car washing service near me?", user_id="user")
print(results)
```
