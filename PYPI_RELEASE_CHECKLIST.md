### Next Steps for Public Release:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Create new repository on GitHub
   # Push your code:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/inmemory.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Set up Repository Settings**
   - Enable GitHub Pages (for documentation)
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Set up secrets for CI/CD (TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN, PYPI_API_TOKEN)

3. **Initial Release**
   ```bash
   # Test release to Test PyPI first
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   
   # Then create GitHub release for production PyPI
   # The CI/CD will automatically publish to PyPI
   ```

4. **Community Engagement**
   - Share on relevant Python/AI communities
   - Submit to awesome-lists
   - Write blog post about the release

### PyPI Installation Commands (After Release):
```bash
# Users will be able to install with:
pip install inmemory                    # Zero setup
pip install inmemory[server]            # With API server
pip install inmemory[enterprise]        # Full enterprise features  
pip install inmemory[full]              # Everything included
```
